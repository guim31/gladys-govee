# Govee

Control your Govee Wi-Fi bulbs, light strips, floor lamps and string lights
from Gladys, **over your local network**: no cloud, no account, no lag. A free
Govee API key optionally adds the devices the local API does not cover (smart
plugs, thermometers, humidifiers...).

> **Developed without the hardware: feedback welcome.** This integration was
> built from the official Govee documentation and from the tests of the
> open-source projects that use Govee's local API, not on real devices. If
> something does not work with your model, please tell us on the
> [Gladys forum](https://community.gladysassistant.com/) or in a
> [GitHub issue](https://github.com/guim31/gladys-govee/issues), with your
> model number (it starts with H, e.g. H6008) and the output of **Search and
> diagnose**.

On top of the device features:

- a **Govee light presets** dashboard widget: warm white, daylight, a short
  list of colors and the Govee built-in scenes, one tap each;
- a **Start a Govee scene** scene action: sunrise, sunset, movie,
  candlelight, romantic, twinkle... on any light that supports Govee scenes;
- a badge on each device telling whether Gladys reaches it locally or
  through the cloud.

The color temperature slider follows each model's own range (for instance
2700 K to 6500 K on the H6076 floor lamp, 2000 K to 9000 K on most bulbs).
Temperatures are shown in **°F or °C following your Gladys profile**: Govee
thermometers report Fahrenheit and Gladys converts if you chose Celsius.

## Before you start: turn on LAN Control

Govee's local API is off by default, **for each light**:

1. Open the **Govee Home** app and tap the light.
2. Tap the **gear icon** (Settings) in the top-right corner.
3. Turn on **LAN Control**.

No **LAN Control** switch? Your model (or its firmware) does not offer the
local API: update the firmware from the same Settings screen, or use the cloud
API key (below). Bluetooth-only Govee devices (no Wi-Fi) cannot be reached by
Gladys at all.

Then find the **IP address** of each light. Your router lists them among its
connected devices: Govee lights often show up as `ihoment_` followed by their
model, e.g. `ihoment_H6008_A1B2`. We recommend giving each light a **fixed IP
address** (a "DHCP reservation" in your router's settings): the integration
follows a light that changes address when it is inside the range you entered,
not elsewhere.

## Installation

Install **Govee** from the integration store of Gladys (Gladys 5.1 or later).
The install screen asks you to let the integration **listen to UDP network
announcements on port 4002**: accept. This is the port Govee lights answer
on (see [How it works](#how-it-works)).

## Configuration

In the **Configuration** tab of the integration:

- **Light IP addresses or ranges**: the addresses of your lights, separated by
  commas. You can also enter a range (`192.168.1.20-60`) or your whole network
  (`192.168.1.0/24`), and the integration finds the lights in it. Up to 1024
  addresses.
- **Light state refresh**: how often Gladys asks the lights for their state,
  to see what you change from the Govee app or a remote (every 30 seconds by
  default). Commands sent from Gladys are confirmed right away, whatever this
  setting.
- **Language of the feature names**: English or French names for the features
  of the devices you add next (Light, Brightness...). Device names come from
  the Govee app when the cloud API is set, otherwise they read `Govee H6008
A1B2` (model and end of the device id): rename them in Gladys as you like.
- **Govee API key** (optional) and **Cloud state refresh**: see
  [The cloud API](#the-cloud-api-optional).
- **Prefer the local connection**: when a light is reachable both locally and
  through the cloud, use the local network (on by default). If a light stops
  answering locally, Gladys drives it through the cloud and the badge turns
  orange to tell you.

Save, then open the **Discovery** tab: your Govee devices are listed there,
add them to Gladys. Click **Scan** to search again at any time.

## The cloud API (optional)

Without a key, the integration is 100% local and never contacts Govee. With a
key, Gladys also reaches the devices that have no local API, and uses the
cloud as a fallback when a light does not answer locally.

Getting a key is free: in the **Govee Home** app, open your **Profile**, tap
the **gear icon** (Settings), then **Apply for API Key**. Govee emails the key
within minutes. Paste it in the **Govee API key** field.

**Quota.** Govee allows **10,000 requests a day** per account. The integration
counts its own calls (the counter restarts at midnight UTC) and:

- lists your devices when it starts, every 6 hours and when you click
  **Scan**;
- reads the state of the devices it drives through the cloud once per **Cloud
  state refresh** (10 minutes by default), never the lights it reaches
  locally;
- stretches that interval by itself if your number of devices would exceed
  8,000 requests a day, and stops reading states at 8,000: the last 2,000
  requests stay available for your commands.

With 10 cloud devices refreshed every 10 minutes, that is about 1,450 requests
a day.

## Actions

In the **Configuration** tab:

- **Search and diagnose**: searches for your devices now and tells you what it
  found: how many lights answer locally, the entries of the address field it
  could not read, how the answers reach Gladys, and the state of the cloud
  connection (number of devices, requests used today).
- **Identify a device**: pick a device, it blinks twice and goes back to its
  state. Handy to tell identical bulbs apart.

## Scenes

The **Start a Govee scene** action (scene editor, **Integrations** category)
starts one of the Govee built-in scenes on a light: sunrise, sunset, movie,
dating, romantic, twinkle, candlelight, breathe, snowflake, energetic,
crossing. It turns the light on first if needed. It works on lights controlled
locally whose model supports Govee scenes.

To set a color, a white tone or the brightness in a scene, use the usual
Gladys **Control a device** action on the light's features.

## Dashboard

Add the **Govee light presets** widget to a dashboard and pick a light in its
settings. It shows the light's brightness and current mode, and up to four
buttons, depending on what the model can do:

- **Warm white** (2700 K) and **Daylight** (6500 K), adjusted to the model's
  range;
- **Color**: pick one of eight named colors;
- **Scene**: pick one of the Govee built-in scenes.

The active preset is marked with a check icon.

## How it works

Govee lights answer the local API on UDP port **4002** of the computer that
asked. Gladys runs each integration in its own container, behind a network
bridge: Govee's automatic discovery (a multicast message) cannot cross it,
which is why the integration needs the addresses of your lights, or a range to
scan.

The integration sends its requests to each light directly. The answers come
back either straight to the integration, or, when the network does not let
them through, to Gladys itself, which listens on port 4002 for a moment on the
integration's behalf (the permission you accepted at install). **Search and
diagnose** tells you which of the two your network uses. Commands (on/off,
color...) need no answer and always go straight to the light.

## Limits

- **Not supported yet**: per-segment colors (RGBIC strips are driven as a
  whole), DIY scenes, music mode, the scenes of the Govee app beyond the
  eleven built-in ones, and the Govee cloud scenes.
- **States are read, not pushed**: a change made from the Govee app or a
  remote shows up at the next refresh (30 seconds by default).
- **Another Govee program on the same computer** (Home Assistant's Govee lights
  local integration, Homebridge...) also listens on port 4002 and may receive
  the answers meant for Gladys: the lights then look unreachable while
  commands still work. Run it on another computer, or use the cloud API key.
- Some recent Govee lights also support **Matter**: you can add those to
  Gladys through its Matter integration instead.
- Govee does not publish the color temperature range of every model; when the
  integration does not know your model, it uses 2000 K to 9000 K, the range of
  Govee's documentation. Unknown models get every light feature: tell us which
  ones actually work.

## Troubleshooting

**No light found.** Check that **LAN Control** is on in the Govee app for each
light, that the IP addresses are right (your router's device list), and that
the lights are on the same network as Gladys. Then run **Search and
diagnose**.

**A light shows "unreachable".** It did not answer the last three state
requests: it may be unplugged, have changed IP address, or its answers may be
captured by another program (see [Limits](#limits)). Run **Search and
diagnose**.

**"Gladys refused the capture on port 4002".** Update Gladys, and check that
you accepted the network permission when installing the integration (reinstall
it if needed).

**"Govee API key refused".** Check the key in the configuration; ask the
Govee app for a new one if needed.

For more detail, open the integration logs from Gladys: every light found,
every refused request and every fallback to the cloud is written there.
